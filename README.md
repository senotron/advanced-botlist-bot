# Advanced Botlist Bot 

Unlike other infrastructures, it was built in a much more advanced and high-quality manner. As you know, a maximum of 50 bots can be added to the discord server. Therefore, thanks to the system I added, all botlist bots will be automatically removed from the server when they complete 30 days (Optional).
